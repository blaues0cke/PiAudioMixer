# PiAudioMixer

This is a small project we built in cooperation with [SAP](http://sap.de) for a school in our city, the [Jakob Gretser Schule](http://www.jakob-gretser-schule.de/). It just plays 16 audio files from a usb stick grouped into 4 groups. We use 16 gpio buttons to control the audio files. One audio file can be played at one time per group.
